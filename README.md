# Ez Eatz
By Jacky Eng, Eddy Chen, Dan Bielli, Danny Chen, and Michael Deng

A semester project from my CSE 442: Senior Software Engineering Course.

Collaborated in an agile pace environment developing an android app in Java that helps people find and decide on nearby eateries based on user's location.

**The learning goals of this project were:**
* Learn to develop in an agile team pace
* Learn to use a scrum board by ZenHub
* Understand workflow and version control by GitHub
* Learn Android Development
  * Performed UI Testing using Espresso framework
  * Implement background tasks using such as AsyncTask in Java
  * Store user's data locally through Android SharedPreference
  * Implement various Android UI concepts in Java along with XML
* Practice documentation as well as other Software Engineering concepts

**For TL;DR Here's my group's presentation which you can skim through:**

* The app uses location services to get user's current location
* Using the data from **Google Place API** we can iterate through the reuslts
* Includes features like bookmark and history!

**Discoveries**
* The app gives a competitive edge to food places that's closest to the customer's location because it shows only one rather than listing all the options at a time, causing unfairness for other eateries, that are yet to be seen, to get a fair chance at being picked. Due to this, we decided to take it down from the play store.
